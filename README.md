# iLEAD TSA Club Website

## Overview
This repository contains the files for the website developed for the iLEAD Technological Student Association (TSA) club. The website was created to provide easy access to information for members of the TSA Club, showcasing club events, announcements, group details, member projects, and biographies of the executive and sub-committee members. Our mission was to launch a comprehensive, dynamic platform by April 2023 that would serve as a lasting resource for future years.

## Current Status
The website's files uploaded here are now outdated. This is due to preparations for the 2024-2025 executive committee. As I transition the responsibilities to the new Historian, these files will serve as a foundation for continued development and enhancements.
